AMS601.3
========

COMASIC AMS601.3 Project

Fondements de l'architecture : fondements de l'informatique.

For this project we are designing a modelling language and a few basic functionalities associated.

A model will consist of objects, relations to other objects, and properties.
The initial model will be read from a file into a shell where it can be edited and worked on (with the aforementionned functionalities), and then written back into a file.

Functionalities will include flattening, abstraction, and comparison.
